## 2020, July 6

This is the day everything started!

My team was going to meet our contractor at Chelsea Residence to discuss the project.

It was raining on that day, but we had a good feeling that everything would go well. At 9:30 am, our team met our contractor, Mrs.L, at a coffee shop near her house. We discussed a lot, but mostly about how to renovate the interiors of her apartment room. Considering both the original plan and her wishes, we understood that the amount of work was significant, which made me excited.

After the chat, everyone went to the room to look at which would be our construction site in the next 3-4 months. Our first thought was that the room is smaller than our expectations.

After the onsite evaluation, the design phase began. The main idea is to expand the living room and combine some functionalities of other rooms with it. To execute this plan, we had to modify the wall layout slightly. Specifically, we demolish the wall between the living room and the kitchen, so these two rooms became one. Such modification enlarged the living room so much that it allowed us to dissociate a small part of the living room for the altar table.

The owner specified clearly that the new design should be modern, clean, and spacious, and most importantly, the interiors should make them feel comfortable. To provide such an impression, we picked white, woo, and light grey as the main colors of the design.

Started with the living room, to provide such a feeling, we designed the ceiling to be high, which comes with an indirect, embedded lighting system. Furthermore, it should be colored in white and included some round corners. Consequently, the whole living room gives the owner the feeling of *pleasant* and *convenient*.

Such an idea did not work for the bedrooms, unfortunately. The main bedroom was quite long and narrow, and we believed that the minimalist design is the most suitable theme for it. We still used white so it could be in sync with the living room.

Kid bedrooms had other requirements. There should be one bookshelf, a study table, and a generous space for playing.

The easiest part is probably the bathroom. Mrs.L simply wanted it to be shiny, clean, and cozy. To provide such a feeling, we painted the room in earthy color to give a comfy feeling, which also helps ease the clean process. The end result pleased everyone involving in the project.

Mrs.L was so happy with our proposal that she approved it almost instantly. It took us only 3 months to complete this project. Despite such a short period, the outcome is perfectly reasonable to the original requirements, every room has its own story which integrates with others seamlessly and adequately shows off the characters of the room owner. This project is my best project in 2020 without a doubt!
