# 2020, July 6

This is the day everything started!

My team was going to meet our contractor at Chelsea Residence to discuss the project.

It was raining on that day, but we had a good feeling that everything would go well. At 9:30 am, our team met our contractor, Mrs.L, at a coffee shop near her house. We discussed a lots, but mostly about how to renovate the interiors of her apartment room. Looking at the original plan as well as taking her wishes into consideration, we understood that the amount of work was significant, which made me excited.

After the chat, everyone went to the room to take a look at which would be our construction site in the next 3-4 months.

Our first thought was that the room is smaller than our expectation.
