We received a call from Mrs.Hai around late 2020, which was going to be our most challenging project in recent years. The contractor requested us to modernize her traditional house without losing its well-known cultural properties of the Vietnamese countryside. Moreover, because her mansion used to be where the residents around her village came and met,  she wanted us to design two buildings. Specifically, one acts as the culture house, and the other is where her family lives.
